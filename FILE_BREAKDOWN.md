# 📁 MealFunding Project - File-by-File Breakdown

## 🏗️ **Core Smart Contract Files**

### 📄 `contracts/MealFunding.sol`
**Purpose**: The main smart contract that powers the entire DApp
**What it does**:
- ✅ **Manages meal funding logic** - Donors deposit AVAX, recipients withdraw for meals
- ✅ **Enforces daily spending limits** - 10 AVAX per recipient per day with automatic resets
- ✅ **Controls access** - Owner approves/revokes recipients, pause/unpause functionality
- ✅ **Tracks balances** - Individual funder balances, total funds, daily spending per recipient
- ✅ **Emits events** - All actions logged for transparency (deposits, withdrawals, approvals)
- ✅ **Security features** - Emergency withdrawal, input validation, modifier-based access control

**Key Functions**:
- `fund()` - Donors deposit AVAX
- `requestMeal()` - Recipients withdraw funds for meals
- `approveRecipient()` - Owner approves new recipients
- `pause()/unpause()` - Emergency controls

## 🚀 **Deployment & Scripts**

### 📄 `scripts/deploy.js`
**Purpose**: Deploys the MealFunding contract to blockchain networks
**What it does**:
- ✅ **Deploys contract** to local, Fuji testnet, or Avalanche mainnet
- ✅ **Logs deployment info** - Contract address, owner, daily limit, paused status
- ✅ **Verifies on Snowtrace** - Automatically verifies contract source code (for non-local networks)
- ✅ **Waits for confirmations** - Ensures deployment is confirmed before verification

**Usage**: `npm run deploy:local` or `npm run deploy:fuji`

### 📄 `scripts/approve-recipient.js`
**Purpose**: Helper script to approve recipients after deployment
**What it does**:
- ✅ **Connects to deployed contract** using contract address
- ✅ **Approves specific recipient** - Currently set to approve `0xf6F5127B2DB69f91638d98Ff120cB2F3530236f3`
- ✅ **Checks approval status** - Verifies recipient is approved before and after
- ✅ **Logs transaction details** - Transaction hash, gas used, final status

**Usage**: `npx hardhat run scripts/approve-recipient.js --network localhost`

### 📄 `scripts/interact-local.js`
**Purpose**: Demonstrates full contract interaction workflow
**What it does**:
- ✅ **Complete demo scenario** - Shows funding, approval, and meal request process
- ✅ **Multiple user simulation** - Uses different accounts for donor and recipient roles
- ✅ **Error handling examples** - Shows what happens when limits are exceeded
- ✅ **Real transaction execution** - Actually executes transactions on the blockchain

- ✅ **Edge case coverage** - Zero amounts, insufficient funds, unauthorized access

**Test Categories**:
- Deployment & Initialization
- Funding Functionality
- Recipient Management
- Meal Requests & Daily Limits
- Pause/Unpause Controls
- Emergency Functions

### 📄 `simulation.js`
**Purpose**: Visual simulation of contract behavior without blockchain
**What it does**:
- ✅ **Mock contract state** - Simulates contract behavior in JavaScript
- ✅ **Step-by-step scenario** - Shows Alice funding, Bob getting approved, withdrawal attempts
- ✅ **Visual logging** - Colorful console output showing each step and state changes
- ✅ **Error demonstration** - Shows what happens when limits are exceeded or insufficient funds
- ✅ **Educational tool** - Helps understand contract logic without gas costs

**Usage**: `npm run simulate`
